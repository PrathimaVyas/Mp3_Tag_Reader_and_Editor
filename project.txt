IN HEADER FILE

-->  we have to declare the functions and then create a structure to read the tag and size from the mp3 file

IN THE .C FILES

--> We have to validate the command line arguments
1. ./a.out
       we have to print error and usage message
2. ./a.out -v filename
        --> we have to view the contents present in that mp3 file
        --> check the file is mp3 file or not
        --> If it is mp3 file then store that filename in the structure
        --> then open the file in read mode and store in the struture
        --> fetch first 3 bytes to check the ID3
        --> then fetch 2 bytes of data to check the version
        --> skip the header till 10 bytes


        --> After 10 bytes read the tag by 4 bytes and size by 4 bytes
        --> This size is stored in the bigendian so convert it into little endian by take one char pointer and run the loop for 2 times and swap
        --> then skip the flag of 3 bytes
        --> take one char array of tag size+1 then read the data from file and store it in that array using fread
        --> Print the content till it reaches the comments follow the same steps

3. ./a.out -e -t/-a/-A/-y/-m/-c change_name filename
        --> we have to edit the things in the input file
        --> open the file in read and write mode then check for ID3 and version then skip header
        --> fetch 4 bytes and do the same process as we did in the view
        --> then check the tags are same or not
        --> if tags are same, store the content in cla into a duplicate array
        --> then write that content to the main file using fwrite
        --> repeat the same process for all the tags
        --> based on the cla, we have to change only that tag's content

4. ./a.out --help
        --> show the data according to which we have to print
